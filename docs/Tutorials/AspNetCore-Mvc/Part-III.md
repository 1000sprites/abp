## ASP.NET Core MVC Tutorial - Part III

### About the Tutorial

In this tutorial series, you will build an application that is used to manage a list of books & their authors. **Entity Framework Core** (EF Core) will be used as the ORM provider (as it comes pre-configured with the startup template).

This is the third part of the tutorial series. See all parts:

- [Part I: Create the project and a book list page](Part-I.md)
- [Part II: Create, Update and Delete books](Part-II.md)
- **Part III: Integration Tests (this tutorial)**

You can download the **source code** of the application [from here](https://github.com/volosoft/abp/tree/master/samples/BookStore).
