## ASP.NET Core MVC Tutorial - Part II

### About the Tutorial

In this tutorial series, you will build an application that is used to manage a list of books & their authors. **Entity Framework Core** (EF Core) will be used as the ORM provider (as it comes pre-configured with the startup template).

This is the second part of the tutorial series. See other parts:

* [Part I](Part-I.md)
* Part II (this tutorial)

You can download the **source code** of the application [from here](https://github.com/volosoft/abp/tree/master/samples/BookStore).
